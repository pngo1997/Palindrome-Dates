# 🏗️ Palindrome Dates Finder

## 📜 Overview
This project implements a Python function to identify and save all palindrome dates in the 21st century (2001-2100). A palindrome date is a date that remains the same when read forwards and backwards, such as 02/02/2020.

## 🎯 Problem Explanation
A palindrome date must satisfy the following conditions:

1. The date is formatted as DD/MM/YYYY.
2. Reading the date forward and backward produces the same sequence.
3. The program should check all dates from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2100.
4. Leap years are treated as regular years, simplifying calculations.
5. The identified palindrome dates are stored in a file for easy reference.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details
1. The program iterates through all dates in the 21st century.
2. Each date is formatted as a continuous string (DDMMYYYY).
3. The string is checked for palindromic symmetry.
4. Valid palindrome dates are written to an output file.
